# Teledermatology_For_Skin_Conditions
This project develops a deep learning-based teledermatology system using transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture to classify 23 skin diseases. It serves as a diagnostic aid for dermatologists and enables early detection for patients in remote areas, enhancing healthcare accessibility with high accuracy and efficiency.
